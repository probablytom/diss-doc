\noindent Currently, testing a model of sociotechnical systems includes modelling the potential difficulties inherent in that system and observing the affects if the system isn't followed correctly. There are some advantages to this approach, as a human observer might be able to pick out mistakes a human actor might introduce into the system. However, this approach can be time consuming and inconsistencies can be introduced when a human models the same system multiple times. \par
A better approach might be to automate the human error involved in the execution of the sociotechnical model. This dissertation suggests a method for modelling sociotechnical systems directly in executable code, and using code fuzzing to simulate human inconsistency as a component of the model. We then provide some example models with this human error built in, and show some example applications of the technique to compare real-world workflows with the actors of the system being taken into account. We also show that the technique works as intended, that it fills a necessary gap in the sociotechnical modelling field, and that the technique has lots of room for future development, though its connections to \(\pi\)-calculus and as a useful method in its own right. \par
