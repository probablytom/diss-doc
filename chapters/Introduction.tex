%The project involves using a form of mutation testing called \emph{code fuzzing} to test models of sociotechnical systems under stress. Some definitions of terms used in this report: 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item \emph{Sociotechnical systems} are configurations of human actors and the technology they use. The human actors affect their environment and operate according to some workflow in an ideal case, though this workflow isn't always followed. This is due in part to the complexity of the system, and in part because the human actors do not exhibit reliable behaviour. Examples of sociotechnical systems are: \begin{itemize}
%\item Planes flown by pilots
%\item Teams of software developers
%\item A family organising a holiday online
%\item The same family booking their holiday through a travel website
%\end{itemize} 
%\item \emph{Stress} on a sociotechnical system is anything acting on the system which might make it change its behaviour; for example, a lack of money or conflict between actors. In particular, this project will be focusing on stresses which result in parts of the system's workflow being carried out without a part or many parts being completed. \par
%\item \emph{Mutation Testing} is the practice of modifying code and running it against tests to check how robustly the tests check the code's accuracy. Particularly, if the code is changed a little and the tests still pass, the tests may not catch incorrect behaviour in the code. \begin{itemize}
%\item \emph{Code Fuzzing} is a type of mutation testing which involves mixing lines of code up, removing lines, and truncating blocks of code, amongst other similar things. \par
%\end{itemize}
%\item The \emph{context} of a sociotechnical system can be considered its environment when it is practised. For example, the cities the actors reside within and the time the system is active at are both parts of the system's context.
