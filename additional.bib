abstract = {This specification defines the Unified Modeling Language (UML), revision 2. The objective of UML is to provide system architects, software engineers, and software developers with tools for analysis, design, and implementation of softwarebased systems as well as for modeling business and similar processes. The initial versions of UML (UML 1) originated with three leading object-oriented methods (Booch, OMT, and OOSE), and incorporated a number of best practices from modeling language design, object-oriented programming, and architectural description languages. Relative to UML 1, this revision of UML has been enhanced with significantly more precise definitions of its abstract syntax rules and semantics, a more modular language structure, and a greatly improved capability for modeling large-scale systems. One of the primary goals of UML is to advance the state of the industry by enabling object visual modeling tool interoperability. However, to enable meaningful exchange of model information between tools, agreement on semantics and notation is required. UML meets the following requirements: A formal definition of a common MOF-based metamodel that specifies the abstract syntax of the UML. The abstract syntax defines the set of UML modeling concepts, their attributes and their relationships, as well as the rules for combining these concepts to construct partial or complete UML models. A detailed explanation of the semantics of each UML modeling concept. The semantics define, in a technologyindependent manner, how the UML concepts are to be realized by computers. A specification of the human-readable notation elements for representing the individual UML modeling concepts as well as rules for combining them into a variety of different diagram types corresponding to different aspects of modeled systems. A detailed definition of ways in which UML tools can be made compliant with this specification. This is supported (in a separate specification) with an XML-based specification of corresponding model interchange formats (XMI) that must be realized by compliant tools.},

@article{Baxter2011,
abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that adopting a socio-technical approach to system development leads to systems that are more acceptable to end users and deliver better value to stakeholders. Despite this, such approaches are not widely practised. We analyse the reasons for this, highlighting some of the problems with the better known socio-technical design methods. Based on this analysis we propose a new pragmatic framework for socio-technical systems engineering (STSE) which builds on the (largely independent) research of groups investigating work design, information systems, computer-supported cooperative work, and cognitive systems engineering. STSE bridges the traditional gap between organisational change and system development using two main types of activity: sensitisation and awareness; and constructive engagement. From the framework, we identify an initial set of interdisciplinary research problems that address how to apply socio-technical approaches in a cost-effective way, and how to facilitate the integration of STSE with existing systems and software engineering approaches. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Obligations can apply to individuals, either severally or collectively. When applied severally, each individual or member of a team is independently responsible to fulfill the obligation. When applied collectively, it is the group as a whole that becomes responsible, with individual members sharing the obligation. In this paper, we present several variations of teamwork models involving the performance of collective obligations. Some of these rely heavily on a leader to ensure effective teamwork, whereas others leave much room for member autonomy. We strongly focus on the implementation of such models. We demonstrate how KAoS policies can be used to establish desired forms of cooperation through regulation of agent behavior. Some of these policies concern invariant aspects of teamwork, such as how to behave when a leader is present, how to ensure that actions are properly coordinated, and how to delegate actions. Other policies can be enabled or disabled to regulate the degree of autonomy of the team members. We have implemented a prototype of a Mars-mission scenario that demonstrates varying results when applied across these different teamwork models.},

abstract = {Topics covered include: The fundamentals of business process modeling, including workflow patterns, an in-depth treatment of process flexibility, including approaches to dealing with on-the-fly changes, unexpected exceptions, and constraint-based processes, Technological aspects of a modern BPM environment, including its architecture, process design environment, process engine, resource handler and other support services, a comparative insight into current approaches to business process modeling and execution such as BPMN, EPCs, BPEL, jBPM, OpenWFE, and Enhydra Shark, process mining, verification, integration and configuration; and case studies in health care and screen business. This book provides a comprehensive treatment of the field of Business Process Management (BPM) with a focus on Business Process Automation. It achieves this by covering a wide range of topics, both introductory and advanced, illustrated through and grounded in the YAWL (Yet Another Workflow Language) language and corresponding open-source support environment. In doing so it provides the reader with a deep, timeless, and vendor-independent understanding of the essential ingredients of business process automation. The BPM field is in a continual state of flux and is subject to both the ongoing proposal of new standards and the introduction of new tools and technology. Its fundamentals however are relatively stable and this book aims to equip the reader with both a thorough understanding of them and the ability to apply them to better understand, assess and utilize new developments in the BPM field. As a consequence of its topic-based format and the inclusion of a broad range of exercises, the book is eminently suitable for use in tertiary education, both at the undergraduate and the postgraduate level, for students of computer science and information systems. BPM researchers and practitioners will also find it a valuable resource. The book serves as a uniquereference to a varied and comprehensive collection of topics that are relevant to the business process life-cycle.},

This state-of-the-art survey presents the results of three workshops of the InterLink working group on software-intensive systems and novel computing paradigms. The objective was to imagine the landscape in which next generations of software-intensive systems will operate and the challenges they present to computing, software engineering, cognition and intelligence. The volume starts with an overview of the current state of the art and the research missions in engineering software-intensive systems. The remainder of the book consists of 15 invited papers of the working group participants and is structured in three major parts: ensemble engineering, theory and formal methods, and novel computing paradigms. These papers cover a broad spectrum of relevant topics ranging from methods, languages and tools for ensemble engineering, socio-technical and cyber-physical systems, ensembles in urban environments, formal methods and mathematical foundations for ensembles, orchestration languages to disruptive paradigms such as molecular and chemical computing.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach to systems modelling based on responsibilities. The approach is designed to help users identify and analyse the hazards and associated risks that can arise in complex socio-technical systems that span organisational boundaries. Through a case study this paper shows how the technique can identify the vulnerabilities that may arise because human, organisational or system agents fail to discharge the responsibilities assigned to them.},
